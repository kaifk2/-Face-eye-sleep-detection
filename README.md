This document is a review report on the research conducted and the project made in the field of computer engineering to 
develop a system for driver drowsiness detection to prevent accidents from happening because of driver fatigue and 
sleepiness. The report proposed the results and solutions on the limited implementation of the various techniques that are 
introduced in the project. Whereas the implementation of the project gives the real-world idea of how the system works 
and what changes can be done in or der to improve the utility of the overall system
